### Performance Improvements

* **client:** don't run search on empty strings ([437c5e6](https://github.com/jaspero/server-manager/commit/437c5e63d0282253d90d9d14205a1fa96aae5779))
* **client:** optimized filter method in instance-overview ([239f2f2](https://github.com/jaspero/server-manager/commit/239f2f25b34f3f22a29e2006709c886199d9a19c))

### BREAKING CHANGES

* The authorization property on modules has been depriciated. Permissions are now controlled exclusively through the permissions object on roles.
* form builder introduces big changes in v5.4.0 that can be considered breaking for JMS. Mainly it's the change in how field save methods are processed.
* Modules are now loaded from memory and are no longer stored in database. Follow the migration guide for more details
https://github.com/Jaspero/jms/wiki/Migrating-to-v4
* **client:** We removed the hideDuplicate property on ModuleInstance.

Features like "duplicate" are now implemented through custom components on the form.
* **client:** we removed the restApi property from the environment. It's now costructed from the region and project in FbService.
* @jaspero/form-builder has been updated from 2.x to 3.x so forks of jms will need to go through the necessary changes to implement tinymce.
* angular v10 and angular/fire 6.0.0
